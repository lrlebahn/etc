    - timbre
    - which “extended techniques” are available to your modules?
    - what kind of workflow(s) do you want? What do you want to achieve? Compositional/recording? Improvisatory? Sketch pad? Capable of abrupt changes?
 
- become better at expressing myself with guitar
- become able to express myself with rhythm + bass 
- write and record >= 12 songs
- experiment with different compositional techniques, forms, etc.
    - build up your own “oblique strategies” but more practical (??)
    - what compositional techniques appeal to you? Which music do you love? What is the compositional techniques that created it?
