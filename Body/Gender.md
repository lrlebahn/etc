> I haven't seen ISTTVG yet, but this fearful apologetic for the closet is wild to me. A lot of us come out & lose all semblance of economic stability either all at once or (as it was for me) slowly & downwardly mobile. But we gain our very selves in the exchange.

I’ve had some serious gender feels the last few weeks… not sure what brought them on, but… ummmm… they are pretty strong???

And today I remembered a random Twitter conversation from 6??? years ago where Dario tweeted “one like, one honest opinion about you, but I won’t name who the opinion is about” and he got a bunch of likes and tweeted a bunch of opinions about our friends, and one of the opinions was very easy to parse who it was about and it was a suggestion to “stop dating corn fed midwestern boys and start dating women because you’re too hot” (or something like that)

I remember liking the thread in the hopes that Dario would tweet about me and how I should be more femme… which is weird and pathetic??? But here I am, this has been on my mind at a low simmer for at least six years

It also goes to my mindset which is I do not trust myself to make a decision and stick by it, and so I have to hide behind somebody else’s opinion

I should write about this more

I’m reading / doing My gender workbook by Kate Bornstein 

One of the exercises asks me to recall a transition in my life and the associated feelings and words that come to mind

I’m thinking of several transitions:

- transition from Christian to atheist, and that gave me a feeling of control, a feeling of openness, a feeling of loss
- Transition back from atheist to Christian which gave me a feeling of belonging and presence
- Transition from student to worker gave me a closing of possibility, a trapped feeling, but also a feeling of accomplishment as I guided my own learning. It also gave me a sense of distance from my coworkers as if I’m different. It also gave me the feeling that I was compromising my values
- And the latest transition from employed to unemployed… gives me a sense of empathy for my former coworkers… and a sense of possibility, and a sense of calm and relief… I was seriously stressed the fuck out up until the end of my job. Also, a feeling of anger that the world is written this way, and is worse for the majority of people in the margins
