i think its very cute and funny how people try to pretend there are no social and cultural signifiers of queerness and transness despite gender and sexuality being social relations and how people are forced to confront their relationship to those by negotiating cisness/hetness

the unstated assumption is that cisness and heterosexuality are indeed just taken as a majoritarian given, and that existing queer and trans people are simply exceptional, i.e. being cishet is a null hypothesis. but this avoids questioning whether it actually is a null hypothesis

its implied in the attempt at an equivocation between heterosexuality and queerness - that allowing someone the space to explore queerness is morally equivalent to trying to convert them into heterosexuality. except the core of this argument - that queerness is coerced on someone - is just the conservative grooming argument behind the mask, and contradicts its own notion that heteronormativity as a default means the vast majority of people are discouraged from exploring queerness

you're left in a situation then, where rather than speech about the self being embedded in a nexus of social relations and life trajectories which bear particular ways a person expresses their existence and social position, speech becomes both the sole exclusive and disconnected from the existence of the person navigating these social relations. but no speech works like this - language is always social, as is gender

actually, if you want to change gender and sexuality (to break gender and sexuality) you are confronted with this very reality of language, gender, sexuality being social
the impetus to make visible how there can be a discordance between identity and social interaction (its true, these are never one to one either, since things are in flux, and "identity" itself is negotiated) is valuable for confronting the ways gender and sexuality are
constructed, affirmed, and subverted. however, for this to have full utility requires confronting the "null hypothesis" of heteronormativity. if you try to do the above but take as a given that it is true humans are simply cishet until proven otherwise, you continuously find
yourself re-asserting homophobia and transphobia, not to mention the misogynistic underpinnings of heteronormativity in the first place
so, for this to work, one has to take seriously the possibility that queerness is a mode of existence for human beings that isnt simply "an exceptional divergence from cis-heterosexuality". actually, you might say heterosexuality is the regime forced upon diverse human queerness
