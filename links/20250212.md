for better or worse, transness at its core is in fact incompatible with the underlying social constructions that make western civilization what it is: settler-colonial, patriarchal, white supremacist, capitalist, imperialist. Our struggle ultimately is for nothing less than the end of empire.  
  
They are right to fear us because they recognize, consciously or unconsciously, the threat we pose to their world. My glimmer of hope is an article of faith that mass support for the end of empire is no longer unthinkable. If we play our cards right, I believe we can tug the world in that direction  
  
Maybe more importantly, these recent developments may help clarify what should have been the case all along: trans spaces, for us and by us, along with the care infrastructure that make them possible (eg diy HRY) are also, at their best, inherently abolitionist spaces  
  
Abolition isn‚Äôt something that‚Äôs achieved globally or society-wide once & for all: it‚Äôs a fundamentally different way of relating to each other, one that‚Äôs fully capable of existing autonomously in pockets regardless of what the state is doing. IMHO, t4t if ‚Äúdone right‚Äù should be a microcosm of this  
  
Fights for de jure protection & recognition, while important in a day-to-day material sense, are valuable insofar as they help carve out space for that better world to flourish. Mistaking them for the ‚Äúreal‚Äù fight is liberalism. I have immense respect for Strangio but i think he would agree
