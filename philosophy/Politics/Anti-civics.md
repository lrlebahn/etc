What would an anti-civics look like? 

#### Citizenship
What are the consequences of viewing oneself as a citizen? Does this distance us from relations with other living beings, with place, with other people?

Does the idea of a citizen create an idea of a non-citizen, both in terms of “someone who is not from here” and in terms of “someone who is from here but doesn’t belong (due to rule breaking, being the wrong race/gender/class/queer/etc. , or not having sufficient team spirit)”

What assumptions undergird citizenship?
#### Law
* [Donald Trump Is No Longer the President](https://jneem.substack.com/p/donald-trump-is-no-longer-the-president) - a newsletter that argues that there is no legal or constitutional responsibility to treat Donald Trump as president since he has broken the law repeatedly

Some thoughts/questions on law:
- are there any liberal resources that critically question the origins of law? or that critically engage with the idea that laws are made by the powerful to benefit the powerful? ("The law, in its majestic equality, forbids rich and poor alike to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal their bread")
- there are going to be many, many PoC who embrace the law and liberal order, because that is the foundation for the rights they have. There is a valid fear that removing the law will bring more suffering meted out by white people (and they are very aware that  the law has also been used to codify slavery, genocide, dispossession, etc.)
- is there anarchist thought about the need to uphold the pieces of the state/non-profits that provide healthcare, food, shelter, etc. until it is able to be replaced by non-state and non-capitalist actors?

#### Autonomy
What the fuck even is autonomy? how would an anti-civics conceive of autonomy? how does the liberal order of today conceive of autonomy?
