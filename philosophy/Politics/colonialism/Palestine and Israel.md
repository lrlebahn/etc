Had a discussion with Adam, Chad, and Luke on the ongoing destruction of Gaza, and it was hard to hear where their positions are on Israel/Gaza. I feel like I need to break down my arguments into smaller pieces, for my own knowledge, and so I can better discuss this:

1. Are Israel's actions toward Gaza in October/November 2023 genocide?
	* Are they war crimes? If so, which ones?
	* Who are the people arguing that this is genocide?
2. How is Israel enforcing an apartheid state in Palestine?
3. Is Israel a settler colonial state?
	* Are settlers tools of the state?
4. What does freedom for Palestinians look like?
	* Where does this leave Israel? Where does this leave Jews in general who see Israel as a refuge?
		* Does Israel provide a refuge for non-white Jews?
5. How does this conflict contribute to antisemitism globally? How does it contribute to Islamophobia?
6. Who is exploiting the destruction of Gaza and for what ends?
	* How are white supremacists exploiting it?
	* How are Palestinian militant groups exploiting it?
	* How is the Israeli state exploiting this?

genocide will always remain a crime that the world prefers to acknowledge in retrospect. an apology, a "never again" pledge, a fact-finding mission, a handful of human remains handed half-heartedly to the bereaved. decades, centuries, lifetimes. genocide exists within the legal

nomenclature as a way to mark exceptional forms of violence,  and to be counted as such, it demands of its victims the willingness to endure spectacle after spectacle of violence so as to be registered as a footnote in a file somewhere‚Äîfinally qualified to be heard before the

sanctimonious temples of international laws. genocide is classified by its supposed rarity, as a horrifying aberration, an unfortunate anomaly in the routine of state violence, civilised, permissible violence.

nakba, on the other hand, gestures an overturning, a calamity in motion, a verb‚Äîpresent continuous. nakba, the catastrophe jostling against all corners of time, a devastation sinking its teeth across all space. nakba, the interstice between each moment that begins, expands israel

genocide is the precision of numbers, nakba is numbers exceeding all imagination, the inability to count any further. every palestinian death and every palestinian dispossession is israel's attempt to continue its beginning. each loss singular, each its own distinct nakba.

if the academic and legal institutions read genocide as an event, nakba asserts its material urgency in its continuum: the settler-colonial project of israel is dependent on nakba to sustain itself; there can be no settler life without the indigenous death.

this is the epistemic weight that nakba carries. dust that continues to rise, wounding that refuses to subside. a doing-undoing.

75 days, and our eyes saw the unspeakable. but this hyper-spectacle of zionist violence is made possible by the slow forms of violence that have

shaped the last 75 years. specifically in the case of gaza, siege has been a measured method of administering death, slowly, without a trace of blood; the city and her people always kept enclosed from all claims to be allowed being counted as human.

[Thread ](https://twitter.com/m_elnaiem/status/1745994585828896936) by Mohammed Elnaiem:

There's something hard for us, children of the colonised, to articulate because the world is upside down. Europe and its descendants, can't differentiate between principle and episode. This is why Germany (and much of Europe) is doomed to be genocidal. Here is what I mean. 

The Holocaust was the culmination of European violence. On principle, its components: racial supremacy, concentration, biopolitics - happened before, ( the Nama and Herero genocide), and elements of it after (Kenya). Europe only feels guilt about the episode, not the principle.

And so Europe believes that its crime was not the principle of genocide as such, but the crime against Jews. It seeks penance for the episode but reconciles itself with the principle of genocide which has been ongoing for centuries, and which was perfected in colonial occupations

And so this is why we see the absurdities in Germany. Germans do not believe that holocausts were the problem, or else they would learn about the Nama and Herero genocide in school. They believe that the holocaust was the problem, and that Israel can give them penance.

The fascist batons, the rounding up of dissidents  the kidnapping, the banning of BDS, the defence of Israel in the ICJ, all of this is fine, because it is not the principle of fascism which it condemns, only the episode. It mistakes the episode for the principal.

And this is how Europe, which refuses to actually confront its violence, will forever be doomed to repeat it. I am Black. I am also a Muslim. There is no longer a Jewish question in Europe (and thank God Europe can learn) but there is a Muslim question.

Every single stereotype, that Palestinians are brutes, human animals, rapists, that they are misogynists, their children terrorists in waiting, women accomplices. These tropes arenot wrong, unless directed at Jews, because the episode, and not the principle is condemned.

Theu can't understand a simple premise which we must try to teach them in vain. The Holocaust, Leopolds Congo, the Malaya emergency, and today, the genocide in Gaza -- all of it must be condemned. What the "jew" was to your grandparents is what the Arab is to you.

And all of this is true, at the same time as the fact that despite all of these attempts at self consolation, Europe is still not safe for Jewish people, because antisemitism is still rampant.

This might not be easy to hear, but this is the absurdity which we confront on our television sets, in silence everyday. You cannot learn. You can't.

When you can say let them drown in the English Channel, or that there is no difference between Palestinian civilians and Hamas. When you can see our relatives fleeing war and treat them like flies and ants; that is the Hitler inside of you. Confront the principle, not the episode
