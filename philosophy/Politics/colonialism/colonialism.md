[Deerhoof](https://twitter.com/deerhoof/status/1787588749959848299) on the necessity of dismantling the US Empire:

Words like "discourse" or "negotiation" are inappropriate when one participant tells nothing but lies, and makes nothing but bogus, bad-faith offers.

The ruling class can't be trusted. Not factually, not legally, not morally, not strategically. Biden and many US lawmakers do not care a pin about mass unnecessary human death. This has been proven to my satisfaction, and well beyond it.

Literally nothing Biden has said on the subjects of Palestine, international law, apartheid, genocide, human rights, self defense, free speech, antisemitism, or his own goals and policies, has been true for half a year now.

Biden the man isn't important. He's just the latest enabler of a monster called the American Empire. His political career is finished anyway. Which doesn't seem to particularly bother the DNC, who are just a private company without convictions or goals, other than fundraising.

Dismantling the US war machine and US poverty machine and US law enforcement machine and the US fossil fuel machine cannot and will not be achieved by voting Democrat or Republican.

UN climate scientists give humans two years to change course on fossil fuels, or the next few decades will see the breakdown of human civilization and mass extinction. Two years is within the next presidential term.

Each US president ramps up fossil fuel extraction from the one before, regardless of party. It's very simple. Democrats and Republicans cannot be entrusted with deciding whether our species survives.

Survival requires an American mass mobilization to dismantle its empire. It doesn't require 100% of the population to do so. That's why I've started ignoring trolls. Seems like 5% general strike would shut this machine down?

The alternative to thoughtfully dismantling our own empire, is to have our empire forcibly dismantled for us by the rest of the globe, who are sick of our nonsense. The US would likely escalate any such attempt to WW3.

The students are now leading the way, as students often do. They are the ones doing the research and the critical thinking, and making the sacrifices. More of us need to follow their lead.
