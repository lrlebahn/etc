is anarchy a politics?

(depends on what politics is)

## think on it

Perhaps the most frustrating part of it being made clear that the whole apparatus holding together the federal government is a paper tiger is that we didn't make this clear before the fascists did.

Obviously the cards were still stacked against us in ways they aren't for the richest man in the world, but these building, these computer systems, these nodes are just run by people.

It's hard not to think of the state - with its police, surveillance, laws, apparatuses, flows of data and money - as being a Big Other (an omnipresence that structures and governs meaning), because states try to appear as a cohesive whole. But like anything else, our imagination fils in the gaps.

I think these knuckleheads have visions of filling in these gaps -- with AI, with total executive power, with corporate takeovers of the state - but it's a phantasmatic vision that cn't be accomplished. There's always people running the codes, locks that can be picked, plugs that can be pulled.

Which is just to hammer home:
- There has never been a more perfect time to ATTACK
- Even if we miss this moment (a moment we should not let pass uncontested!) there is no future where the gaps are filled, and those gaps are where they're vulnerable. Hope should never be lost.

I strongly feel that it's worthwhile for (at least some) anarchists to prioritize projects that create "points of encounter" between people and manifestations of antagonism to the existent, to have projects that take up physical and visual space whenever and wherever we can.

Whether it's downtown, in the suburbs, or in rural gathering places, finding ways to make explicit that there are people who refuse the normalization of this world of death machines is vital for helping us to find one another and expand what type of resistance is possible.

I'm always on about tabling (especially in public spaces) not because I think handing out zines makes insurrection or that we should act as recruiters to some ideology, but because it increases points of encounter that make it possible for people to more easily take action.

There are people who have met at the table who I've seen go on to roll as a crew at a later demo. I've seen people make reading groups out of zines they take. Also, just knowing you aren't alone can be a huge factor in helping one to take on more bold and courageous action.

A greek comrade said this words at some meeting in 2012: 

"Every anarchist group should establish 5 key infrastructural pillars: social space, gym, radio, printing shop and solidarity fund. If we can do it in our small town everyone can do it."

Part of our strategy since then.

I find that "Are you an Anarchist" Graeber essay to be frustrating because it frames anarchy as an innate feeling/belief rather than an ==intentional way of existing/negating/building particular ways of relating==. Its target audience is those who are almost certainly not anarchists.
