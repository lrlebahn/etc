> All I can say is that the problems are the same today as they were the day before yesterday—there is no path out of this mess that doesn’t involve revolution. Even if you think it’s unlikely (it isn’t) we need to orient toward that. I hope more people join me in this conclusion

What if… just hear me out… the issue isn’t whether or not revolution is possible, but that your conception of revolution isn’t desirable bc it’s ultimate goal is the reorganization of productive forces instead of their abolition and the actual freeing of human activity?

Okay so actually I’m willing to talk at length about how people imagine a revolution to be bc I clearly don’t disagree with the notion of complete social upheaval but the idea of revolution parsed thru a red lens just looks like broader proletarianization and no fucking thx.

“How do you imagine the process and the aftermath? What does it take for it to start, sustain, and succeed? How do you measure success? What happens while the dust is settling? Once the dust has settled?”

Naming the desire isn’t enough anymore.

There’s an ever-present urgency that can’t be denied cuz I feel it too but I don’t share any of the conclusions of the militant revolutionists and I know damn near nobody is on Team Make Total Destroy so just short of finding a middle ground I think there’s much to discuss.
