[Mutual Aid, Community Resiliency, Disaster Collectivism ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ss8cKIXTXiKWA9CW5lPFTIJi764KzRtdF60VjrZmmiY/edit?tab=t.0)
[Take One Step, Every Day](https://www.cawshinythings.com/take-one-step-every-day/)


We either grit our teeth, scale up our mutual aid, + brace to lose so many people to dungeons, exile, murder, and suicide, or we hit the streets so fucking hard we enter The Cool Zone, which will also require us scaling up our mutual aid, so, scaling up our mutual aid is a good call for right now

Trans people have been living through Great Depression levels of employment and wealth, so have many black and indigenous communities, so if you're wondering how you survive people suddenly losing jobs and support and funding left right and center there are people in your community with experience

One thing people who don't already regularize this practice are gonna have to get used to: dropping everything to help a near stranger with a weird, frustrating or time consuming logistical/emotional errand. Poor and surviving communities often call this "a day ending in y"

Things middle class ppl may not think of as valuable resources but that are: capacity with form completion, having a car, having a couch that's empty at night, having a full fridge, quickly understanding and summarizing information, knowing how to deal with banks/government agencies/managers

being willing and able to sit on hold for long periods of time, time in general, time in specific, free time, time without anxiety and crushing existential angst, alone time, time that doesn't involve someone else's problems, operational heating, fast internet, reliable utilities, hot water

things everyone can share (if true): give someone you know but aren't super close with your address, and tell them that if the shit hits the fan and they gotta get the fuck outta town, they can come to you, someone who is not connected readily to them, for a few days

things everyone can share: you know the neighbors who you're friendly with, you smile and nod and shit? if you don't have it, get their phone numbers and other contact info. Maybe make a group chat or an email list. this kind of communication infrastructure is everything in a crisis

more specific projects that will be crucial in the coming months just from what we already know: communal child care, shared pharmacies, food distro, mask blocs, eviction/sweep defense, public spaces where ppl dont have to spend money, food and water storage/prep, alternate power creation/generators

more specific projects cont: exercise/training groups, self-defense classes, grief and trauma support, self-guided therapy groups, elder care, crews to distro to elders/immobile/shut-ins, emergency response teams, street and DIY medics, free literature/zines, communal art and crafting get togethers

raves/music and art shows/happenings, tagging wheatpasting and propaganda teams, direct action research clusters, prisoner and jail support, returning from prisons support, legal aid, letter writing, anti-fascist researchers, doxxing teams, strike and picket support, local resistance info sharing

community announcement threads/accounts, digital safety trainings, building Mesh networks/independent comms, radio and walkie-talkie prep, food/calorie gardening, urban guerilla gardening/beautification, land-reclamation, hospital and clinic defense, create a squatted hospital, learning how to squat

driving lessons, flying lessons, building cross state networks, community snow shoveling, community cooling centers for the summer, building DIY air purifiers, building heaters for people/heater bloc, teach people lock picking, organize people who want to learn trades/building into labor brigades,

eviction rapid response networks, rent strike organizations, organizations that publicize and support strikers and picket lines, land projects where people can lie low, land projects where people can get away for a few days, festivals and rituals, birth and pregnancy support, death doulaing,

There is a lot to do, but you only have to do one! If none of them call to you, figure out one that does. If literally any of them do, take one (1) material step today towards doing it. This material step might just be texting ppl: Hey [friend], i want to start a free store. Any interest?

This material step might be: researching online to figure out if ppl in your area are doing that or have done it in the past, or asking a local punk/DIYer/organizer/transsexual with a special interest if they know anything about it.

Then, having done that material step, you're gonna go back to your regular stuff. But first you're gonna put in your calendar/mind palace/a stickie on your forehead a reminder to take a second step tomorrow. Say, get everyone who said "yeah, sounds cool!" into a group chat and propose a meeting.

Good second step! Now you've been doing mutual aid for two days. Fucking rad. Lets plan a third step tomorrow. "Vicky this is slow af, what the hell?" I promise actually doing the thing? ripples out, motivates everyone else to also do one thing. One thing a day is genuinely high level

You've already got so much on your plate. One thing a day is insanely efficient. Anyone who has worked in an crew for a long time knows that if everyone in that crew did one thing a day toward the crew it would be going three times as fast as it does now, right?

ok, day 3, you've got the group chat, now you're gonna just propose a meeting time and location/make a calendaring thing. That's it. That's day 3. One text/email/carrier pigeon. Is that slow, or did you just go from nothing to having a group making plans to meet to discuss how to make it happen?

But vicky, this is incredible easy, basic shit. OMG you're right! Building community is second nature, it's what we fucking do, and we're fucking good at it, we're evolved to do it, and this world has built a massive ideological and material apparatus of violence and separation to make us forget

but the thing is, we haven't forgotten, instead histories and communities of resistance have kept us here. We're still here. The only way we're really doomed is if we forget how to do this, which is what the fascists want. Practicing care for one another is a victory over their misery and hatred

These are dark times, but these practices have gotten us through the "good" times too. This world of the colonizer has only ever had good times for very few. More USians than ever are about to lose the last vestige of good times. Welcome friend. We've been here, and we know what to do. Grab a shovel

Honestly the cold is keeping a critical mass of people from getting out in the streets and letting off steam, the steam is just building and building, the vibes are very much the combination despair/rage/impatience as early 2020 rn, as long as that persists I'm gonna keep naming it

if, like me, you're feeling that disturbing and often demobilizing stew of rage, despair, impatience and possibility, take a material step toward building power and mutual aid. If you took the streets in 2020, think about one thing you would've liked to have achieved that you weren't ready to do

I don't mean "overthrow the government" I mean, what was a step you and your crew could've taken in that moment that would've resulted in longer lasting power, comfort, or safety. What's one target in the city you wish the crowds had managed to take out/take over/empty?

What's one practice or form of community organization you wish you could have established? Maybe take steps to try and make that happen in the rupture to come. Call an assembly of friends and neighbors. Make plans with an AG. Make a poster or a sticker that you can distribute to put the word out

What's one way police or prisons could've been materially weakened, one that wouldn't require legislation or policy?

How does a crowd empty a jail? How does a crowd overthrow a detention center? How does a crowd empty a concentration camp? How does a crowd stop a deportation?

What's the best place to hold a neighborhood assembly?
Where does the police department store its vehicles?
How do we communicate without internet or phone access?
What businesses stock pile generators, water filtration systems and solar panels?
Where could you safely lay low if you had to?

Who do you know who could get water and electricity back up in an empty commercial building?
What would we need to keep ourselves fed for a month without markets?
What's the meeting point if shit pops off?
Where is the nearest national guard barracks?
Is there an armory nearby?

Who needs to hear these questions? How can you make sure they do?

[It's all spectacle until it isn't, then it is again.](https://twitter.com/drawn_daggers/status/1779332670406730204)

> The only way to move beyond spectating is to decide what you actually want of this world, and then to act, to shape daily life towards that desire. 
>
> I want(need) all of this to go. Every border wall, every military, every prison and every precinct. Nothing short of everything.
>
> Do not resign yourself to simply spectate, allowing power to define the terms of your resistance. There is so much life to be found in recognizing the capability you hold in your fists, alone or collectively with others. Find what is killing you and fight, often and bold.
