[BrownSundjata](https://twitter.com/BrownSundjata/status/1752786587925029067) on Marxism and Eurocentricity:

Imma let yall finish, but it's kinda hard to convince me that Marxism isn't itself Eurocentric when Engels imputed the vanguard role of the German workers' movement to their people's sense for theory and lessons learned from France and England. We know Chris Hani, BPP etc. Still.

I read Kevin Anderson's Marx at the Margins and still was not convinced Eurocentrism doesn't shape Marx's conception of history. His changing views on the dynamism of India didn't amount to a rejection of the AMP thesis + still thought more industrialized countries lead the way

Samir Amin wrote a whole book on Eurocentrism and then revealed a stagist prejudice against less stratified and centralized West African polities in Global History: A View From the South. To show how pernicious the historical dialectic as described in Anti-Duhring really is

I tend to take Wynter's position on this and other discourses emerging from European humanism. Beyond Marxism, but not without it
