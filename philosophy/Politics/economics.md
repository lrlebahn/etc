*from Mimbres school discord discussion on Graeber's Debt*

its interesting, there's a settled but imprecise alliance here, because the success of Graebers Debt came about in a post-2008 occupy new new left etc confluence, i dont know how it matters yet but Debt basically became the "anthropological" point of reference for the Bernie / Corbyn policy MMTers, to overcome the "eurocentric" accusation because their vision "long"-history vision based on Knapp’s The State Theory of Money (1891) and Mitchell-Innes The Credit Theory of Money (1914) who only touch on Europe. Randal Wray's "The Origin of Money" (1993) touches a bit of "medieval europe" and for archaic and "primitive" he relies on Polanyis misleading "culture-war" Methodenstreit with the neoclassicists who saw barter as commercial proto-money, which was counterposed by fictive societies segmenting or domesticating the commercial "special purpose, non-profit" etc. So Graeber is for them a shorthand of this narroq entire anglo-american tradition in economic anthropology (Malinowski-Polanyi) etc, even though Graeber has his own "value" theories that no one ever cites in these money discussions based on Mauss and Turner along (+ the same thing happens to Michael Hudson, he is cited as an authority on Babylon, to give a “non-Eurocentric” “universal” rhetorical padding, to chartalist theories centred entirely on modern European states, with emerging central banks, which have precious little insights to offer on ancient and non-state economies, while all of Hudsons other many ideas and insights, like getting rid of central banks, are not discussed at all.
