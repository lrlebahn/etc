I think it is important to acknowledge that I am not a Christian, and hope never to be one again. 

I read some tweets by saintbt7 (Abolition of the World) today

> The Left will continue to think ChristoFascism is not that big of a problem and that is why they will continue to be 50 years behind as always

And

> The Global organizing Christofascists have is on another level.

And a retweet:

> No offense because I grew up that way but seeing Christianity make a legitimate comeback as a serious practice is a true sign of a deteriorating culture and society

I think Christianity is fatally poisoned, but also that poisoning has happened over the course of 1800 years. Christianity amassing power is nothing new. Christianity using that power to repress and kill peoples is nothing new. I think I fooled myself into thinking it could be different in 2016 when Lauren and I started going to St. Pauls. 

Beyond the poisoning of Christianity, itâ€™s foundation is rotten - the idea of sin as the ultimate concern is as ridiculous as it is frightening.

The hatred for the body also repels me. 

Christianity goes against all my important beliefs - the worship of authority, the simultaneous minimization of the group and the individual, the distrust of others, the shrinking of majesty of life and beauty, the destruction of nature (dominion), the hatred of autonomy, and on and on
