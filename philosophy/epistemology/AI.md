The 'ai' fraud is a uniquely dangerous accelerationist scam because its harms begin right now and extend indefinitely:

• in the short term, it fucks up your immediate work, needs, safety,and erodes trust in any image or text

• creative people are instantly impacted as workers &victims of plagiarism

In the medium term, it is designed to figleaf unlimited job losses, and loss of services, in all the vital areas to social function: educators, health workers, knowledge & admin workers, engineers, technical writers, the list is endless.

Long term, added to social damage, it means loss of capability in areas that were built over thousands of years: Loss of literacy for generations, and loss of engineering capability (which was already hanging by a thread)

We're being lied to, while our media is so shallow &controlled that people can't perceive the crimes in progress. Therefore the appropriate opposition has not been mounted and probably will not come from the institutions that were meant to protect us all from such cynical depredation.#aifraud

It's easy to understand the size of this problem: Right now, these 'ai' toys are being rolled out, the people who LEARNED, at great effort and dedication, these skills being superficially emulated, like writing, are being laid off because that is capital's goal. Laid off, many will never recover. …

Now, combine that with the defence of 'ai's ridiculously poor output with: "With human review, it's a net win."

1) Capital just laid off most of the humans with skills to DO that review, and increased the workload of any remaining by adding very low quality work.

But much worse:

2) The PROCESS by which new generations gain the ability to DO that work—learn to write, build, design, draw, help, experiment, do science, invent—has been SEVERED by the replacement of people with fraudulent 'ai' toys. While 'ai' is in the chain, new generations simply have no way to skill up.

Because,as we know, we learn by doing; we learn from mentors; structured teaching by humans. And ALL those things are specifically destroyed in this fraudulent 'revolution'. So we will no longer be able to do any of those things, see or correct the gross errors of glorified random number generators.  

We are not angry enough.

Capital finally found a way to _completely_ murder the humanities in one last gasp of venality. If they win, it's lights out for all of us, or at best, an indefinite dark age while we rebuild.  

Five years ago I wouldn't have thought there was such a weapon.

I wonder if de-skilling the vast majority of people from reading &writing,

+ destroying public services, libraries, historical archives and searchability
+ controlling what people read by controlling _and owning_ the technology that presents it all

…is good for the capitalist agenda? anyone know?

…and it's telling that it started with, and cannot /exist/ without, the largest and most shameless theft of creative work in human history.

Does the process of generating, gathering, analyzing, and utilizing data control/mediate the “human experience”

i.e. in gathering data it is necessary to simplify and flatten the subject that is being measured, and then when that data is utilized in decision making, the decision itself is flattened by the data that was collected, AND by the way the data was analyzed

?taylorism/scientific management?
