I am tickled that this [thread](https://x.com/PeoplesOracle/status/1603182865612738562) by Dayna Lynn Nuckolls (@PeoplesOracle) is the first entry in this topic. It raises some very important questions, and is sadly prescient

>2 things on my mind for the activity in Aries and Libra and Pisces and Virgo in 2023 beyond:
>
>RE Jupiter in Pisces and eclipses beginning in Pisces and Virgo:
>
>AI, cults, high control groups 
>
>Deep learning technology is basically synthesizing and processing all of the content and data it has access to in order to form a judgement. This makes artificial intelligence a...
>
>collection of our prejudices. I mean this in the sense of all of the biases of the dominating culture which overlaps w/ what is deemed to be knowledge—what is taken for granted as fact.
>
>It duplicates, speeds up, & replaces the human labor of pattern recognition & identification.
>
>This is also related to rising anti-intellectualism and declining literacy rates. All of this opens the way to a rise in cults and high control groups.
>
>Decreasing literacy rates on top of cultural indoctrination leaves ppl vulnerable to disinformation that exploits ignorance and
>
>confusion that comes from not being able to read for comprehension.
>
>Charismatic figures use rising skepticism and paranoia towards authority to claim a unique interpretation of world events. A culture of abandonment and neglect at every single level of society leaves folks vulnerable to these folks who make them feel special and seen.
>
>We will also see a continued rise of interest in the occult, paranormal phenomena, and ritual within and outside of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. There will be high control groups emerging over the next several years in these religions too. Esp apocalyptic end times ones.
>
>I had a professor in college when I was abroad in Switzerland, Colin Guy Backus. This was almost 20 years ago, 2004. In one class he told us that in the future emotional states would be created artificially with technology. It sounded absurd then, but now? 
>
>RE Jupiter in Aries and eclipses in Aries and Libra
>
>What is the meaning and function of work, philosophically and politically? Who is capable of working? Who is able to be employed? What does it mean to be employed?
>
>This will lay the ground for Saturn in Aries 2027-30.
>
>- Legal protections and the lack of them for workers
>- Unions and union busting
>- General strikes and work stoppages
>- Continued decline of employed and employable people
>- Power and resistance
>- Governability and ungovernability
>- Ability and disability
>
>Governments will either:
>
>- Give in to the demands of citizens
>- Be disrupted, destroyed, or overtaken by nefarious actors (like the charismatic figurehead of a cult/high control group) OR the people
>- And/or become a full on authoritarian dictatorship
>
>2023 is a major turning point for AI, and for culture in terms of the power of the state and the people, and who has control over them.
>
>There will be major opportunities to resist. But also, many will find themselves caught up in scams and other situations.
>
>I cannot overstate the importance of discernment.
>
>Discernment =
>・Who do I trust?
>・What do I trust them for?
>・When do I trust them?
>・Which faculty of mine will I rely on to form judgements in the situations I find myself in? Hearing, sight, feeling, or belief?
>
>We can already see a rise of charismatic figures across the political spectrum.
>
>Liberals/neoliberals have their thought leaders, gurus, and influencers
>
>Evangelicals have their pastors and teachers
>
>The right has their slew of politicians
>
>The left has their intellectuals etc
>
>Anyone of these folks can and will rise up as the leader of a high control group. It's easier to see on the right because the dem/liberal media is obsessed with them as a kind of virtue signaling. "Look at how dumb these conservatives are? How could they be so easily fooled?"
>
>And the thing about high control groups is that after a while, the leader is merely a symbol that will eventually be discarded or swapped out.
>
>Particularly with images and videos on the internet, so much disinformation, lies, and scams will be.
>
>Curiosity is a form of protection. Reading, increasing your media literacy, a healthy level of skepticism towards the info we encounter.
>
>A strong set of morals is also a form of protection. Being manipulated & coerced into doing deplorable things is the American way. But that is way easier to do when our morals are weak & easily set aside.
>
>The antidote for being oppressed by one group's morals is to have your own
>
>I should add more info here. He said that emotional states would have codes and that you could request to experience a certain emotional state by name with this code or sequence of characters.
>
>As I said up thread... The rise in cults is inevitable. High control groups and religions.
>
>2023-24 gonna be the year y'all finally start listening to me.
>
>(Not you. I know you've listened. And it has strengthened my faith in my gifts and the power of this work I've been given. Thank you.)

Questions:
- how do we know what we know?
- How do we know what we know is true?
- How do we know that what others claim is true? (i.e. credentials, how do we know a doctor is good at treating patients)
- What are the frameworks for epistemology? What are the frameworks for evaluating “truth”? For example, for a Dr. it might be true that fenphen causes weight loss, but it also has fatal side effects
- How do we evaluate competing truth claims?
