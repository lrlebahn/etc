What does [this](https://x.com/boguswaves/status/1818372369670381709) mean:

> Conflict is dialectical, antagonism is not.
	Antagonism: "an irreconcilable struggle between entities, or positions, the resolution of which is not dialectical but entails the obliteration of one of the positions" - Wilderson III
>
	For Wilderson, conflicts can be solved but antagonisms mean destruction.

is AI able to read subtext?

[StarQueen_9](https://twitter.com/StarQueen_9/status/1773060203434349049) on domesticated animals and the sociogenic underpinnings of "nature"

In reponse to [this](https://twitter.com/dee_bluehead/status/1773059127624802335) tweet about Flaco the owl:

> This thread is reminding me of how most of us do not actually know how nature & ecosystems work & it’s v sad lol. We’ve been sold these stories abt how ~animals belong in nature~ without as much emphasis on the actual ecosystems around us and how they function.

This type of thinking is how/why so many local ecosystems get filled with abandoned pets who either die because they can't survive or they impose added pressures to the local wildlife (flora + fauna).

You can't simply toss domesticated animals and plants "into nature." Nature is a sociogenic phenomenon. The idea that animals have something pristine to them which ur supposed to 'restore' is an inversion not a subversion of the logics that guide the idea that ownership is okay.

The paternalism in either case literally exhibits valency in how these beings end up experiencing 'nature' and in historical consequence of that, we have to be dialectical about our solutions to the associated problems. Actual lives of individual organisms + whole populations are at stake. How we relate to wildlife, domesticated species, and then limnal species (as Benedicte Deboisseron discusses in "Afro-Dog: Blackness and the Animal Question") which can neither exactly be classified as wild or domesticated --- it is an extremely delicate project.

And it can't be divorced from the work of transforming the human substructural and superstructural relations.

“we cannot conceive of alternatives within the discursive possibilities we currently inhabit.”
Foucault 

‘I think that to imagine another system is to extend our participation in the present system’.
Foucault

What do these mean?

What is a system?

> The reason this matters is that we often apply concepts to individuals that actually must remain about relationships.

> For example, we might talk about a person as “criminal” but a person out of context is not criminal; It’s a relational abstraction with others.

> A very uncomfortable truth is that living in brutal circumstances will break and even warp a person. I know we all want to believe that violently oppressed people are morally correct and have never harmed anyone - and some are! - but part the violence of oppression is how it breaks your morality.
>
> My Holocaust survivor grandmother was a *fucking nightmare*. Was she like that before being imprisoned in the Kovno ghetto? Possibly!
But I feel certain that living in those brutal circumstances did not improve her moral compass, and her kids paid the price.
> 
> I think a lot of people see Palestinians as an abstract concept of oppression, and do not really want to engage with what it actually does to a person to live in oppressive conditions for decades - far longer than my grandmother was imprisoned in the Kovno ghetto!
> 
> It does not surprise me that some - *some* - Palestinians have reacted to decades of brutality with brutality. And I think the fault lies at the feet of both Israel and the international community for allowing Palestinians to be collateral damage to the world divesting itself of a Jewish diaspora.
>
> IDK, just think we need to be able to accept that being monstrously oppressed can make people act monstrously, and that that is why WE SHOULD STOP OPPRESSION FROM THE START.
